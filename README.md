# Web Application

## Intro

This demo is a email collection web application.
The project is mainly based on MySQL and Node. Requesting data through Client Server, Node and database integration to achieve data acquisition and return data through Node, and use HTML to realize the design of web interface, implemented updating email data synchronously and inserting the obtained email into database.

## 

* [Express](https://expressjs.com) is the framework I used to build this web application.

```

* Used [**faker**](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate tons of fake data in the brower and node.js
